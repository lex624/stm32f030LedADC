# stm32f030LedADC
This project aims to develop embedded c code for the stm32f030k6t6 mcu.
The functionality required will be to develop ADC for use as a low battery monitor, 
SPI for an LED driver (STP16CP26) to control 4 pairs of LEDs
Finally 3 buttons, one to be implemented as on switch with the other 2 used as 
up and down buttons (implemented as output GPIOs)
The code can is tested on a nucleo64 development board and debugged using IAR IDE
